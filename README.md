# Lecture-Listener
Github for Senior Capstone project Lecture Listener

Lecture Listener is an application to provide live closed captions during lectures. These closed captions are then saved in audio recordings and transcripts to be listened to or viewed later.

# TODO
* Make it so the app can work without connection to AWS, but display warning popup that nothing will be saved.
